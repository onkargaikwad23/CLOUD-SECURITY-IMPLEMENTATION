# üîê Task 4 ‚Äì AWS Cloud Security: IAM Policies, Secure Storage & Encryption

## üìå Objective

Implement **IAM policies**, configure **secure storage**, and enable **data encryption** on AWS to ensure data protection and restricted access.

---

## üîß Steps Performed

1. **Created IAM Policy (JSON)**:
   - Allowed only `GetObject` and `PutObject` actions for a specific S3 bucket path.
   - Attached policy to a custom IAM role `S3LimitedAccessRole`.

2. **Created IAM Role & Attached Policy**:
   - Role for Lambda or EC2 instance with restricted access.
   - Verified role permissions with test requests.

3. **Configured Secure S3 Storage**:
   - Enabled default server-side encryption (SSE-S3).
   - Verified object encryption metadata on uploaded files.

4. **Enabled Bucket Versioning**:
   - Ensured multiple object versions are retained for accidental overwrite protection.

5. **Tested Permissions**:
   - Verified that unauthorized roles or users were denied access.
   - Tested successful access with the allowed role only.

---

## üìé Deliverables (Per Instructions)

‚úîÔ∏è **Configured Security Policies**:
   - IAM policy JSON file (`iam-policy.json`) provided.
   - Screenshot of attached role and policy.

‚úîÔ∏è **Report Detailing the Setup**:
   - This `README.md` explains the full implementation and reasoning.

‚úîÔ∏è **S3 Encryption Enabled**:
   - Screenshot included of S3 bucket with SSE-S3 enabled.
   - Object metadata showed `x-amz-server-side-encryption: AES256`.

‚úîÔ∏è **Access Control Verified**:
   - Public access blocked.
   - Role-based access allowed selectively.

---

## üñºÔ∏è Screenshots Folder Includes

- IAM policy creation interface
- S3 bucket with encryption and versioning enabled
- Object upload with encryption header
- IAM role attached to Lambda or EC2
- Permission test result (denied/allowed)

## üìö Detailed Description & Use Cases

Cloud security is a critical aspect of deploying infrastructure on AWS. Misconfigured permissions or unencrypted data can lead to serious security breaches. This task helps establish a secure-by-design architecture using AWS-native tools like IAM, S3, and KMS.

### üéØ Real-World Use Cases

#### ‚úÖ 1. **Enterprise Data Access Control**
Organizations enforce strict access control to ensure only specific teams (e.g., data scientists) can access specific buckets with read-only permissions using IAM roles and policies.

#### ‚úÖ 2. **Encryption Compliance**
For industries like finance and healthcare, it's mandatory to encrypt sensitive data at rest. AWS S3 supports server-side encryption using both **SSE-S3** and **SSE-KMS**, ensuring compliance with standards like HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and GDPR.

#### ‚úÖ 3. **Secure Application Integration**
Lambda or EC2 instances often need scoped access to specific files or buckets. By using IAM roles with least-privilege policies, cloud architects avoid exposing broader resources.

#### ‚úÖ 4. **Audit and Logging**
All access and actions in S3 can be logged using **AWS CloudTrail**, ensuring full auditability. Versioning protects against accidental deletions and changes.

## üîê Security Best Practices Demonstrated

- **Least Privilege Access**: Only allowed necessary permissions for specific resources.
- **Encryption at Rest**: Enabled default encryption for all objects in the bucket.
- **Block Public Access**: Ensured bucket is not accessible over the internet.
- **Policy Testing**: Verified access via CLI and Console using test users/roles.

---

## üß† Skills Gained

- Writing and understanding IAM policies
- Applying IAM roles to compute services (Lambda, EC2)
- Using S3's encryption and access management features
- Interpreting S3 object metadata and permissions
- Applying security-first principles in cloud design

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This task taught critical concepts in cloud security by implementing IAM roles, least-privilege policies, and encryption measures in AWS. Secure cloud design is foundational to production environments, especially where sensitive or mission-critical data is stored. These skills are indispensable for roles such as **Cloud Security Engineer**, **DevSecOps Engineer**, or **AWS Solutions Architect**.
